# PROBLEM STATEMENT :
---
Urban transportation plays a pivotal role in the daily lives of millions, and public buses are a critical component of this ecosystem. Many times it may have happened so, that you might not have gotten any information about how much more time it takes for any bus to come to the stop. It feels like there is a huge gap in information between the passengers/commuters and the public bus system. In this day and age where data and information are such a crucial part of the lives of many such a gap in information does not seem right! Hence it is where "Moveasy" comes into play.
The "Moveasy" project is conceived to transform the public bus commuting experience by providing a robust solution that offers real-time information about the location of buses near users, along with a wealth of essential data pertaining to daily public bus travel.
People often face various problems during their daily public bus travel. These issues can vary depending on the location, the quality of public transportation services, and other factors. These factors can be - <br>
●	Overcrowding <br>
●	Delays <br>
●	Unreliable schedules <br>
●	Long wait times <br>
●	Accessibility issues <br>
●	Lack of seating <br>
●	Poor maintenance <br>
●	Safety concerns <br>
●	Inadequate information <br>
       And the info about the Limited routes and coverage etc.




# PROPOSED SOLUTION :
 --- 
 We have hence tried to implement a one-stop solution for the above-stated problem with the help of "Moveasy" which is a 2 apps-based project idea - one for the POS device and the other for the consumer's app.
Consumer App:
The consumer-facing mobile app offers a user-friendly interface that allows daily bus commuters to effortlessly track the live location of public buses in real time. This app provides passengers with valuable information such as bus arrival times, current bus routes, and estimated arrival times at specific stops. Users can access this information conveniently on their smartphones, making their daily commutes more predictable and efficient. Not just by providing the location of the nearby buses on a neat map of the area, but also allowing them to use the app just to buy the ticket before even boarding hence making it easier on public bus staff during crowded hours.

Key Features for Consumers:

Real-time bus tracking: Users can view the live location of buses on a map.
Bus routes and schedules: Access to detailed information about bus routes and estimated arrival times at various stops.
Customized alerts: Set notifications for bus arrivals, delays, and route changes.
User-friendly interface: An intuitive design for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
POS Device App:
The POS device app is installed on Android-based POS devices (which are currently used as handheld ticketing devices) within public buses. It serves as the backbone of the system, collecting and transmitting live location data to the central server, which is then made available to consumers through the consumer app, in case of any emergency or bus wreckage, the bus staff could directly by a push of a button send an alert to all the emergency services such as Police, Ambulance, etc. 
By utilizing existing POS devices, this project eliminates the need for costly geolocation hardware in buses and makes it a reliable source to track the bus so that help can be sent out in time of an emergency.

Key Features for POS Devices:

GPS Integration: Utilizes the built-in GPS capabilities of POS devices to track bus locations.
Data transmission: Securely sends real-time bus location data to the central server.
Minimal hardware cost: Eliminates the need for additional geolocation devices, reducing operational expenses.
Robust data security: Ensures the protection of sensitive location data.

MOVEASY is an innovative solution that benefits both public transportation authorities and daily commuters. By leveraging existing POS devices, the project offers a cost-effective way to improve bus tracking accuracy and enhance the overall public bus travel experience. This system has the potential to reduce operational costs, increase passenger satisfaction, and contribute to the efficiency of urban transportation networks.



# ADMIN DASHBOARD 
 It is the admin dashboard created using " taipy " for the officials who may have to access the data for auditing purposes or just for normal daily checks and to look for any malicious activities







## How to run ADMIN_DASHBOARD locally -

<u>first of all run</u>

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt </code>

<u>Now, Run the main.py file</u>
